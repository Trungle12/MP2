# MP2
For extra credits, I've made the following addition to MP2
  1. A button that made the enemy flying objects move forward
  2. When the enemy flying object hit the world boundaries, it would make a 180 turn
  3. Added health to the player character. Starting at 100, when they collide with the enemy flying object, the player will take 10 damage
  4. When the player take damage, their color alpha will decrease to indicate as s7uch
  5. When the player health hit 0, they will return back to the normal state, that is 100 health and normal alpha color. 
  6. Added a death counter to tell the player how many times they have perished. Increases when player health hit 0
  7. Added Controls
